            <h2>Courtesy</h2>
            <p>When Bouldering, there are common courtesies that you should keep in mind when interacting with other Boulderers</p>
            <dl>
<dt>Overlapping </dt>
<dd>When embarking on a climb, make sure that it dosen't overlap with a climb that another person is doing, as it can lead to collision and injury. </dd>
<dt> Chalk</dt>
<dd> When taking community chalk, always make sure to put it down where you got it, so that other people can easily locate it.</dd>
<dt>Crash Pads</dt>
<dd>Make sure to keep the crash pads clear of personal items and rubbish, and don't sit on them either. </dd>
            </dl>
