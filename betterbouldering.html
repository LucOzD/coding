                <p>When climbing for the first time, people often become confused and overwhelmed, unable to figure out what to do.</p>

<dt>Shoes</dt>
<dd>Bouldering shoes are provided by the gym, with an option to bring your own. These shoes should be tight but not painfully so.</dd>
<dt>Chalk</dt>
<dd>In most gyms, there will be a community chalk supply. Squirt onto your hands and return the bottle to where you got it so that other people can use it.</dd>
<dt>Bags</dt>
<dd>Most gyms will have boxes or containers where you can put your gear. Please do not leave this on the floor, as it creates a hazard for other boulderers.</dd>
